# finAPI Client

The client generated by `swagger-codegen` is messy and hard to use
because it implements a lot of features like models with validations and
so on.

This is an attempt to create a more light-weight, rubyesque client for
the API. The design is heavily inspired by Ismael Celis' [Writing a Hypermedia 
Client in Ruby](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/writing-a-hypermedia-api-client-in-ruby).
Thanks for the article!

## How To

Since there aren't many endpoints supported at the moment, the only real
use-case is to retrieve a user's transactions from the API. To do so you
must add a new user to your finAPI account using other means than this
client (e.g. the sandbox @ https://sandbox.finapi.io). Once you have a
user, you can initialize a new session using the user's token:

```
# Initialize a new session
session = FinAPI::Session.new("USERS_API_TOKEN")
```

You can then retrieve the users transactions like this:

```
# Retrieve a single transaction by ID
session.transactions.find(123)

# Retrieve an interable collection of transactions
session.transactions.all
```

The `#all` method supports additional parameters as by the API spec.

## Supported Endpoints

GET /transactions/{id}
GET /transactions
